        <p>Hachikō the dog was more than just a pet. Hachikō, a university professor's canine companion, patiently awaited his owner's return from work each evening at their local train station.</p>
<p>But when the professor died unexpectedly at work one day, Hachikō was left waiting at the station for nearly a decade. Every day after his master died, Hachikō returned to the train station.</p>
