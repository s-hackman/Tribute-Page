        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Hachikō the dog was more than just a pet. Hachikō, a university professor's canine companion, patiently awaited his owner's return from work each evening at their local train station.</p>
        <p>But when the professor died unexpectedly at work one day, Hachikō was left waiting at the station for nearly a decade. Every day after his master died, Hachikō returned to the train station.</p>
        <p>Hachikō was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. After time, Hachikō apparently realized that Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. Each day, Hachikō waited for Professor Ueno to return. And each day he didn't see his friend among the commuters at the station.</p>
        <p>The permanent fixture at the train station that was Hachikō attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Realizing that Hachikō waited in vigil for his dead master, their hearts were touched. They brought Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.</p>
        <p>This continued for 10 years, with Hachikō appearing only in the evening time, precisely when the train was due at the station.</p>
